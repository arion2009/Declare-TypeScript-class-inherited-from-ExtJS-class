This is a demo to show how to inherited a ExtJS class in typeScript like that:
  class myForm extends Ext.window.Window {
     constructor() {
        super();
     }
     
     initComponent() {
        super.initComponent();
        ...
     }
  }
  
Basically I already done it, but since I am new in GibHub, so need come more time
to understand how to upload it, please wait ...
