This is a **demo** to *show* how to inherited a ExtJS class in typeScript like that:

```javascript
    class myForm extends Ext.window.Window 
    {
       constructor() {
          super();
       }
    
       initComponent() {
          super.initComponent();
          ...
       }
    }
```
  
Basically I already done it, but since I am new in GibHub, so need some more time
to understand how to upload and manage it, please wait ...
